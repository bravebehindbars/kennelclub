                        human lives in terms of companinonship but also in working side by side with humans to hunt
                        game, herd sheep, and push sleds. Canines are most happy when they serve their master so what
                        better way to put their unique skills to use and in the process bring betterment to lives of

            <h3>"Parents should consider their children's sensitivities carefully when choosing a pet to ensure a good
                match, Dr.Carlisle emphasizes. 'Bringing a dog into any family is a big step, but for families of
                children with autism, getting a dog should be a decision that's taken vey seriously,' she says. For
                example, a child who is easily agitated or has sensitivities to noise may have great difficulty with an
                extremely active dog or one that tends to bark."
